# KnowYourself
An app that uses transparently uses weather, sleep and location data and manually inserted stress data to predict the future well being of its user. I've developed this project a couple of years ago and it can be improved with serious object oriented programming and a good software architecture. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather and its forecast and the Smile Machine Learning library.
